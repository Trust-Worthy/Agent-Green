# 🌿 FOSS Energy Tracker

**Track and estimate the carbon footprint of AI agents, local compute, and LLM API calls in real time.**

This project enables developers and researchers to measure the energy and carbon impact of ML/NLP workflows, including inference loops involving OpenAI models, local computation, and simulated agents. It’s designed with a sustainability-first mindset—ideal for those who care about green software, open source, and ethical AI.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📊 **Step-level tracking** of CPU/GPU energy use
* 🌎 **Carbon emissions estimation** based on region
* ⚙️ Support for **external energy costs** (e.g., LLM API token-based usage)
* 🔌 Uses `psutil`, `nvidia-smi`, and/or Intel RAPL (where available)
* 🧠 Example: Run a simulated AI agent that uses OpenAI + local compute
* 🌐 Flask-based API with frontend for interactive testing

## ⚙️ Installation

First, clone the repo and set up your Python environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/foss-energy-tracker.git
cd foss-energy-tracker

# Optional but recommended:
conda create -n GreenSec python=3.12
conda activate GreenSec

# Install dependencies and the library itself in editable mode:
pip install -e .
```

---

## 🔑 API Key Configuration

If using OpenAI models:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

---

## 🧪 Usage

### 🖥️ Run the Flask App

By default, this runs on port 5000. Make sure it's free:

```bash
# Optional: kill any app using port 5000
lsof -i :5000
kill -9 <PID>

# Then run:
python app.py
```

You can now interact with the `/run-simulation` endpoint:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/run-simulation?model=gpt-4o-2024-05-13"
```

Or open `frontend/index.html` in your browser for a simple UI.

### 🧠 What Happens During a Simulation?

1. The agent starts up.
2. It runs 3 reasoning/planning turns using an OpenAI model.
3. Local post-processing is simulated to approximate CPU energy.
4. The tracker collects:

   * Duration of each step
   * CPU/GPU energy draw
   * External (LLM) estimated energy
   * Total carbon footprint (in grams CO₂)

A sample JSON response might look like:

```json
{
  "total_duration_sec": 8.23,
  "total_energy_kwh": 0.00057,
  "total_carbon_gco2": 0.33,
  "steps": {
    "turn_1_planning_with_llm": {
      "duration": 2.13,
      "cpu_energy_kwh": 0.00012,
      "external_energy_kwh": 0.00021,
      "total_carbon_gco2": 0.15
    },
    ...
  }
}
```

## 🧰 Developer Notes

* If port 5000 is busy, change it in `app.py`:

  ```python
  app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
  ```
* To test individual components:

  ```bash
  python tracked_heavy_computation.py
  python integrated_ai_agent_demo.py
  ```

## 🌱 Why This Matters

Green software is secure software. This project lets you **quantify and visualize the energy + carbon cost** of AI workloads so you can:

* Compare local vs. cloud inference
* Measure cost per model/token
* Optimize compute pipelines for sustainability

---

## 📦 Roadmap

* [ ] Add CodeCarbon integration
* [ ] SQLite/CSV log storage
* [ ] Web dashboard with charts
* [ ] Support for ARM/Apple Silicon energy readouts
